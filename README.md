# zenWay
Combo of Jeffrey Way PhpStorm theme and default PhpStorm.

zenWay theme combines one that Jeffrey Way used in Laracasts Laravel 5 Fundamentals tutorials, and the default PhpStorm theme.

One that Jeffrey used is great, but I miss the bold fonts that PhpStorm default theme has for keywords, variables, etc.

So I hope you'll like it.

Enjoy.
